## The Game
You are a artilleryman placed on a faraway base that is about to be ambushed by the bad guys. Your objective? Shoot their helicopters and planes down before they either bomb your base to smithereens or get their paratroopers high enough to snipe down your base!

* Killing a paratrooper - <b>10 points</b>.
* Shooting down a helicopter - <b>30 points</b>
* Shooting down a jet - <b>50 points</b>

Each artillery fire costs <b>5 points</b>, so be careful!

## Losing criteria
* <b>3 hits</b> from an aircraft bomb will destroy your base. You can shoot the falling bombs with your artillery to destroy them before they reach!
* If you allow <b>5 paratroopers to stack themselves on top of each other</b>, they will snipe down your base with a laser guided RPG.

## Controls
Left and Right keys to move your artillery. Space to shoot.
